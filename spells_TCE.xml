    <description>
      <p>You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes ld8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.</p>
      <p class="indent">This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra ld8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by ld8 at 1 1th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).</p>
