			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Maneuvers.</em></strong> You learn three maneuvers of your choice from the "Maneuvers Options" section later in this subclass's description. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Superiority Dice.</em></strong>  You have four Superiority Dice, which are d8s. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong>  If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus.</p>
