			<p>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.</p>
			<p class="indent">Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.</p>

			<p>When you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">You choose the weapon's form each time you rage:</p> 
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Bite</strong> Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals ld8· piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.</li>
				<li><strong>Claws</strong> Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It deals ld6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.</li>
				<li><strong>Tail</strong> You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals ld8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.</li>
